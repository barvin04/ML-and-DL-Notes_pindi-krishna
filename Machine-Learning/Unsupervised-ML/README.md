# Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction to Clustering
Clustering algorithms are used to group data points based on certain similarities. There’s no criterion for good clustering. Clustering determines the grouping with unlabelled data. It mainly depends on the specific user and the scenario. Clusters found by one clustering algorithm will definitely be different from clusters found by a different algorithm.

Typical cluster models include:

1.  Connectivity models – like Hierarchical clustering, which builds models based on distance connectivity.
1.  Centroid models – like K-Means clustering, which represents each cluster with a single mean vector.
1.  Distribution models – here, clusters are modeled using statistical distributions.
1.  Density models – like DBSCAN and OPTICS, which define clustering as a connected dense region in data space.
1.  Group models – These models don’t provide refined results. They only offer grouping information.
1.  Graph-based models – A subset of nodes in the graph such that an edge connects every two nodes in the subset can be considered as a prototypical form of cluster.
1.  Neural models – Self-organizing maps are one of the most commonly known Unsupervised Neural networks (NN), and they’re characterized as similar to one or more models above.
